# caddy

## This is nothing more than **[Caddy reverse-proxy](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)** with some additional modules.

* Platforms: **`armv6`**, **`armv7`**, **`arm64`** and **`amd64`**
* **Multiarch image**, Docker should automatically pull the correct platform
* Image is **not auto-built** but built manually triggered only when updates have been done
* Pull from the **[Docker Hub repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/l33tlamer/caddy)** with **`docker pull l33tlamer/caddy:latest`**

These modules have been added:
